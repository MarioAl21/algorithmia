# Binary Search
The idea behind this algorithm is divide in two parts every time the problem domain.

Sometimes is not about of encountered a solution in fact, but most efficient solution (when is convinient update a possible solution).

How far can I get, and how much resources I gonna have left.

When is convenient hold a possible solution, and when not, & what segment we have to drop or discharge.

What happen with my half?

## Types: 

- Closest to the left

- Closest to the right

*When ordered our array?*

## Binary Search the answer
Estimate a answer and close to it. 
We even need to save data in an array!
Update the result every time more optimous.
